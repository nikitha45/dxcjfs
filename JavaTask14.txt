->  create table for player
   -> with 6 properties
 
->dob
player id
player fname
player lname
decide other 2 by yourself

create a sequence to generate number from  1 -100

---------------------

write a jdbc application to create , update , delete, getAllPlayers   and getplayer by name..


while create a player player id is first 2 chars of fname of the player
first 2 chars of lname of the player and an auto generated seq num from the data base

Ex: Virat Kohli
player id: ViKo001

Rohit Sharma
player id: RoSh002

---------------------------------------------------------------------


create table player(playerId int, player_fname varchar(20), player_lname varchar(20), player_dob Date, player_country varchar(20), teamId int); 



sequence -auto generated number


create sequence MySeq
start with 1
increment by 1;


select myseq.nextVal from dual;


select myseq.currVal from dual;

create table testseq
(
test int
);


insert into testseq values(myseq.nextval);

insert into testseq values(6);

insert into testseq values(7);

nextval -> 6

delete from testseq
where test=myseq.nextval;

-------------------------------



create sequence MySeq
start with 1
increment by 1;


select myseq.nextVal from dual;


select myseq.currVal from dual;

create table testseq
(
test int
);


insert into testseq values(myseq.currval);
forloop
insert into testseq values(myseq.nextval);
insert into testseq values(myseq.nextval);
